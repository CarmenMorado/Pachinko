# Pachinko
100 Days of Swift (Project 11) A game similar to pachinko using SpriteKit. Throughout the course of this project, I familiarized myself with SKSpriteNode, 
SKPhysicsBody, SKAction, SKPhysicsContactDelegate, SKLabelNode, SKEmitterNode, and more. The entire objective of the game is for users to customize the 
amount of boxes on the screen and attempt to make them disappear while aiming for green slots. At the start of the game, the user has only 5 balls at their
disposal. However, landing on a green slot earns them an extra ball.
