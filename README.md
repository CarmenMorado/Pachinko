# Pachinko
100 Days of Swift (Project 11) A game similar to pachinko using SpriteKit. Throughout the course of this project, I familiarized myself with SKSpriteNode, 
SKPhysicsBody, SKAction, SKPhysicsContactDelegate, SKLabelNode, SKEmitterNode, and more. The entire objective of the game is for users to customize the 
amount of boxes on the screen and attempt to make them disappear while aiming for green slots. At the start of the game, the user has only 5 balls at their
disposal. However, landing on a green slot earns them an extra ball. In addition, I completed the following challenges:


-The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
-Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.


-Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
